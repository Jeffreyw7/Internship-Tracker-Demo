# Validation record

Email verification was validated September 27, 2026, using Java 21.0.12.1, Maven 3.9.11, Node 25.2.0, and Spring Boot 3.5.16. The earlier September 23 record covered the dark-mode update.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| TypeScript + Vite production build | Passed |
| Client/API, verification-link, theme-state, and palette tests | 31 passed |
| Spring Boot integration, mail, rate-limit, and migration tests against H2 | 41 passed; no failures or skipped tests |
| Flyway V1/V2-to-V3 account upgrade + Hibernate validation | Passed; pre-V3 accounts are exempt and later accounts require verification |
| Executable JAR with bundled React assets | Built successfully; 5 frontend resources copied into the JAR |
| Real HTTP and SMTP-capture smoke test | Passed, including pending-account denial, email confirmation, CSRF, CRUD, and logout |
| File-backed H2 persistence after stopping and restarting the JVM | Passed; verified account, Dark preference, and application record survived |

Backend coverage includes password-first verification denial, generic resend and duplicate-registration responses, rejection of client-supplied exemption state, one-time/CSRF/password-protected confirmation, concurrent confirmation, persistent bad-password rate limiting, and existing-account migration behavior. Mail tests cover AES-GCM round trip and tamper rejection, transactional enqueue, eligibility checks, payload erasure, transient retry, permanent failure, retry exhaustion, lease ownership/takeover, terminal cleanup, and expired rate-limit cleanup. Sensitive authentication DTOs have redacted string representations so framework debug logging does not print email, password, or token values.

The HTTP smoke test launches the executable JAR on loopback with a temporary H2 database and an in-process SMTP capture server. It checks the website and static assets, registers an account, confirms that login is denied before verification, extracts the delivered token, confirms with the signup password, signs in, saves Dark appearance, rejects invalid and CSRF-free preference writes, creates/updates/deletes/restores a record, rejects a stale update, restarts the JVM, signs in again, verifies both the record and appearance, and checks logout. It does not touch user data or contact an external mail provider.

PostgreSQL and Docker Compose were not run because Docker is not installed in this environment. The V3 SQL is exercised in H2 PostgreSQL mode, and the Compose configuration was source-reviewed, but those checks do not establish PostgreSQL runtime compatibility. Browser automation was also unavailable: the Vercel `agent-browser` executable was absent and no browser surface was attached. The packaged page and all referenced JavaScript/CSS assets were fetched successfully through real HTTP, but this is not a visual or console-error check. No hosted deployment or external SMTP delivery was performed.

Run the current checks with:

```sh
npm test
npm run build

# From backend/ (use .\mvnw.cmd on Windows)
./mvnw test
./mvnw -Pwith-ui clean package

# Back at the repository root
npm run test:smoke
```

The Node smoke runner uses only built-in modules and required project runtimes. The older Python runner remains available for environments that already use it.
